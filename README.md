**Project Type:** Exploratory Computational Neuroscience

## Overview

This project explores orientation pinwheel patterns in the visual cortex  and their information-theoretic properties using Fisher information.  

It is an independant personal project, experimenting with neural dynamics, simulations, and coding explorations.  
The goal is to explore how orientation selectivity is represented around pinwheel centers and investigate the behavior of Fisher information as the number of stimuli increases, with and without a prior.

## What's in this repo

- `orientation-pinwheels.ipynb` -> Main Colab notebook for simulations and analysis   
- `figures/` -> Generated plots 
- `README.md` -> Project description and instructions  

---

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
2. Run each cell sequentially  
3. Modify parameters to explore different priors, noise levels, or grid sizes

## Notes

- This is an **exploratory project**; no formal publication yet.   
- The code and plots are **meant for learning and exploration**, not as a finalized study.
- **tweak, explore, and have fun experimenting!**
