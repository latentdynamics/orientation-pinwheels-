**Project Type:** Exploratory Computational Neuroscience

## Overview

This project explores orientation pinwheel patterns in the visual cortex  and their information-theoretic properties using Fisher information.  

It is an independant personal project, experimenting with neural dynamics, simulations, and coding explorations.  
The goal is to investigate the behavior of Fisher information as the number of stimuli increases, with a von mises and a uniform prior.

## What's in this repo

- `orientation-pinwheels.ipynb` -> Main Colab containing the full simulation and analysis pipeline. includes exploratory code, left intentionally messy. 
- `FI_map(uniform prior).ipynb` -> Colab notebook for visualizing FI using a uniform prior, stimuli orientations evenly placed.
- `FI_map(von mises prior).ipynb` -> Colab notebook for visualizing FI using a uniform prior, stimuli orientations sampled from a von mises prior.
- `mean-variance(uniform prior).ipynb` -> Colab notebook for plotting mean and variance of FI at the pinwheel center as number of stimuli N varies, with evenly spaced stimulus orientations.
- `mean-variance(von mises prior).ipynb` -> Colab notebook for plotting mean and variance of FI at the pinwheel center as number of stimuli N varies, with stimulus orientations sampled from a von mises prior.
- `README.md` -> Project description and instructions

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in Google colab
2. Run each cell sequentially  
3. Tweak parameters and experiment with different settings

## Notes

- This is an **exploratory project**; no formal publication yet.   
- The code and plots are **meant for learning and exploration**, not as a finalized study.
- **tweak, explore, and have fun experimenting!**
